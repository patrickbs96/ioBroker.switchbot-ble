# Switchbot (BLE) adapter for ioBroker

![Number of Installations](http://iobroker.live/badges/switchbot-ble-installed.svg)
[![github-workflow](https://github.com/mrbungle64/iobroker.switchbot-ble/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mrbungle64/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)

This adapter allows you to control your SwitchBot "Bot" and to monitor the temperature/humidity from SwitchBot "Meter" via Bluetooth (BLE).

## Before you install

* If you are looking for Hub Plus/Mini support, [this adapter](https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker.switchbot-hub) is what you will need

## Supported OS

This adapter may only run on Linux-based operating systems, as the underlying library [node-switchbot](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/node-switchbot#supported-os) currently only supports Linux-based operating systems such as Raspbian and Ubuntu.

## Installation

It is recommended to use version 12.x or 14.x of Node.js.

The minimum required version is 12.x

Before installing the adapter, some linux libraries related Bluetooth as follows if the OS is Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

Running without root/sudo (Linux-specific):

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```

This grants the `node` binary `cap_net_raw` privileges, so it can start/stop BLE advertising.

__Note:__ The above command requires `setcap` to be installed.
It can be installed the following way (e.g. Raspbian and Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
```

See the documentation of [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#readme) for other details.

## Models

### Supported models

* SwitchBot "Bot"
* SwitchBot "Meter"

#### Other models (experimental)

* SwitchBot "Curtain"
* SwitchBot "Contact"
* SwitchBot "Motion"

## Usage

### Remarks

#### SwitchBot "Bot"

* If you use the "Bot" in "Switch Mode" 
  the value of the state "control.inverseOnOff" should be the same as "Inverse the on/off direction" in the app.
  This cannot be synchronized automatically.

#### All models

* The battery data is marked as experimental in the library for now.
  So there's no guarantee that the value is correct.

## Troubleshooting

If the adapter no longer works, e.g. after a restart or system update, please try the following:

```bash
cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.switchbot-ble/
sudo rm -r node_modules/
npm install
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
